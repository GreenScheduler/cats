The objective of the present study is to provide estimates for the 2020 use stage electricity consumption and ICT sector’s total lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions divided in three main parts: user devices including internet-of-things, networks and data centers. The study builds on a high number of data sources including measured and reported data from 150 companies that is estimated to cover about 80% of network subscriptions, about 55% of data center electricity, and about 35% of upstream GHG emissions. To understand the development, the results are put into the perspective of earlier studies. In conclusion, the ICT sector used about 4% of the global electricity in the use stage and represented about 1.4% of the global GHG emissions in 2020. The use stage electricity consumption and the total GHG emissions have increased since 2015, but the impact per subscription has decreased. The user devices accounted for over half of all GHG emissions, with equal parts relating to use stage and other lifecycle stages. For networks and data centers, the use stage GHG emissions are dominating. The electricity consumption and GHG emissions are also estimated for the closely related areas Entertainment and Media (including e.g., TVs), paper media, and cryptocurrencies.}, journal={Telecommunications Policy}, author={Malmodin, Jens and Lövehagen, Nina and Bergmark, Pernilla and Lundén, Dag}, year={2024}, month=jan, pages={102701} }

We also study the energy requirements and carbon emissions of its deployment for inference via an API endpoint receiving user queries in real-time.

            Bioinformatic research relies on large-scale computational infrastructures which have a non-zero carbon footprint but so far, no study has quantified the environmental costs of bioinformatic tools and commonly run analyses. In this work, we estimate the carbon footprint of bioinformatics (in kilograms of CO2 equivalent units, kgCO2e) using the freely available Green Algorithms calculator (www.green-algorithms.org). We assessed (i) bioinformatic approaches in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), RNA sequencing, genome assembly, metagenomics, phylogenetics and molecular simulations, as well as (ii) computation strategies, such as parallelisation, CPU (central processing unit) vs GPU (graphics processing unit), cloud vs. local computing infrastructure and geography. In particular, we found that biobank-scale GWAS emitted substantial kgCO2e and simple software upgrades could make it greener, e.g. upgrading from BOLT-LMM v1 to v2.3 reduced carbon footprint by 73%. Moreover, switching from the average data centre to a more efficient one can reduce carbon footprint by ∼34%. Memory over-allocation can also be a substantial contributor to an algorithm’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The use of faster processors or greater parallelisation reduces running time but can lead to greater carbon footprint. Finally, we provide guidance on how researchers can reduce power consumption and minimise kgCO2e. Overall, this work elucidates the carbon footprint of common analyses in bioinformatics and provides solutions which empower a move toward greener research.}, journal={Molecular Biology and Evolution}, author={Grealey, Jason and Lannelongue, Loïc and Saw, Woei-Yuh and Marten, Jonathan and Méric, Guillaume and Ruiz-Carmona, Sergio and Inouye, Michael}, year={2022}, month=feb, pages={msac034}, language={en} }

Reflecting on the example of France and the Green Algorithms tool.}, rights={Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International}, url={https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.14607021}, DOI={10.5281/ZENODO.14607021}, abstractNote={Artificial intelligence (AI) is in the media spotlight for its potential to transform the economic and research sectors, among others. This drives funding bodies to support AI-based innovation, with for example the Horizon Europe and Digital Europe programmes run by the European Union, or France’s investment strategy France 2030 (national strategy for AI). On the other hand, the environmental impacts of AI are now better understood, and we cannot ignore the role of AI on electricity and water usage, mineral resource depletion, and greenhouse gas emissions1,2. To bring together innovation and sustainability, the French Department for the Environment (Ministère en charge de la Transition Écologique) has decided to require the use of the Green Algorithms tool for funding applications on the topic of AI and climate change. Applicants now have to include estimates of the carbon footprint and energy usage of the different development phases of the proposed AI solution. This was tested on a first funding call “Demonstrators of frugal AI for sustainable development of local communities”. The first applications were received in December 2023, with positive feedback from the different stakeholders. Applicants in particular approved of this new criterion, as they understood its necessity, found the tool easy to use, and did not consider this to slow down innovation. Following this successful implementation in a first funding call, it was decided to include the Green Algorithms tool more systematically in the application guidelines of other AI-related funding calls run by the Department. The goal of this piece is to reflect on the inclusion of environmental criteria in AI funding calls and share the lessons learned with other funding bodies internationally to promote similar initiatives across the AI ecosystem.}, publisher={Zenodo}, author={Lannelongue, Loïc and Fropier, Juliette and Matencio, Even}, year={2025}, month=jan, language={en} }
